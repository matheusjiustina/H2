# AGRO WINGS

Agricultural aviation on a Mato Grosso farm (Fazenda Boa Esperança, fictional).
Three.js + Vite, everything procedural (no external assets), built into a
single self-contained `dist/index.html`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # dist/index.html (single file)
npm test           # flight + spray validation (Node)
```

URL option: `?q=low|medium|high` forces a graphics preset.

## Gameplay loop

Service orders (3 contracts) → load sheet (fuel / application liquid) → the
badeco services the aircraft on the pad → engine start → taxi → take-off →
spray passes → return → landing → taxi to the pad → shut down → results and
payment in Cr$ → next order. Partial work can be handed in; landing for a
reload keeps the coverage (also saved in `localStorage`). Free flight mode
starts on the pad or airborne.

Contracts (`src/game/contracts.js`):

| id | Talhão | Crop | Area | Challenge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| soy | T-07 | soybean 0.8 m | 18.4 ha | wide, flat, beside the strip — learn the circuit |
| corn | T-12 | corn 2.4 m | 16.1 ha | tall canopy on a swell, tree line west, power line east |
| cotton | T-03A + T-03B | cotton 1.2 m | 13.8 ha | two fields split by the creek — valve off over the gap |

Evaluation: useful coverage (dose ≥ 0.7 of target), uniformity (1 − CV of
dose), gaps, overlap (dose > 1.5), waste (off-target + drift/evaporation +
over-application) and aircraft condition (repairs).

## Controls (Tidemark aircraft mapping kept)

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Pitch | W / S (↑ ↓) |
| Roll | A / D (← →) — also steer on the ground |
| Rudder / tailwheel | Z / X |
| Power | R / F (Shift / Ctrl), mouse wheel |
| Brakes (differential with rudder) | Space |
| Flaps | G (up) / B (down) |
| Trim | [ / ] |
| Engine | hold Q to start, tap Q to stop |
| Spray valve | C (Enter) |
| Cockpit / chase | V |
| Free external camera | O |
| Service / interact | E |
| Map / coverage overlay / contracts | M / K / J |
| Reset aircraft | Backspace |
| Speed up ground service | hold T |

All bindings are rebindable in Settings. Mouse: left-drag looks, right-drag
is a virtual stick. Gamepad: left stick, triggers = power, bumpers = rudder,
A = spray, B = brakes. Touch devices get a stick, a power slider and buttons.

## Flight model

`src/flight/flightModel.js` is a port of the Tidemark floatplane model: same
lift/drag/stall blending, stability derivatives, prop wash on the tail,
engine torque and p-factor, ground effect and gyroscopic terms, and the same
assist control law (`src/flight/assist.js`, modes off / normal / high) and
input shaping rates. Changes for an agricultural taildragger:

- spring/damper main gear and steerable tailwheel, rolling resistance per
  surface, brakes (differential with rudder), small ground irregularities;
- mass, inertia and CG change with fuel and hopper load;
- fixed-pitch prop: static thrust fades toward pitch speed, windmill drag at
  idle (gives a real glide);
- fuel burn and starvation; crop-canopy drag and crop strikes.

The simulation runs at a fixed 120 Hz with an accumulator and render
interpolation. All tuning values live in `src/config.js`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs `test/flight.test.mjs` and `test/spray.test.mjs` (Node).
Browser checks (need `npm run build && npx vite preview --port 4173`):

- `node test/e2e.mjs soy out/` — full contract flown by the test autopilot
  (`src/game/autopilot.js`) through the normal player inputs only;
- `node test/e2e_ui.mjs out/` — service interruption, crash + recovery,
  stuck reset, key rebinding, tutorial, mobile layout;
- `node test/perf.mjs` — per-view tick/render time, draw calls, triangles.
